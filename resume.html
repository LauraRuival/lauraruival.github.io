             <p>I'm a full-stack software engineer with over 15 years of experience. I'm interested primarily in Web and mobile app development. 
                 I have used many languages for development projects including JavaScript, VB, VB.Net, C# and more recently iOS Swift. 
                 I've done mobile app development using using Xcode, Xamarin and Visual Studio. 
                 I am also well-versed in relational database design and have worked primarily with SQL Server, including SSIS packages and SQL Server Reporting Services.
