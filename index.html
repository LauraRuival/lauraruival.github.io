    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I'm a full-stack software engineer with over 15 years of experience. I'm interested primarily in Web and mobile app development. 
        I have used many languages for development projects including JavaScript, VB, VB.Net, C# and more recently iOS Swift. 
        I've done mobile app development using using Xcode, Xamarin and Visual Studio. 
        I am also well-versed in relational database design and have worked primarily with SQL Server, including SSIS packages and SQL Server Reporting Services. 
        I enjoy creating user-centered UIs and solving problems.</p>
    <p>Since 2018 I have been teaching coding and robotics in the Alpine Union school district. 
        My latest adventure is teaching computer science courses to high school students through UCSD Extended Studies. 
        I have taught iOS Swift Programming, Front End Web Development and currently co-teach Robotics with JavaScript. 
        I also teach coding camps to elementary students through Sally Ride Science at UCSD Extended Studies.</p>
